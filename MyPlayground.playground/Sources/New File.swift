 •    The string “rotator” should return true.  
 •    The string “Rats live on no evil star” should return true.  
 •    The string “Never odd or even” should return false; even though the letters are the  same in reverse the spaces are in different places.  
 •    The string “Hello, world” should return false because it reads “dlrow ,olleH”  backwards.  Hints  Hint #1: You can reverse arrays using their reversed() method.  Hint #2: Two arrays compare as equal if they contain the same items in the same order. They are value types in Swift, so it doesn’t matter how they were created, as long as their values are the same.  Hint #3: The characters property of a string isn’t really an array, but you can make it one using Array().  Hint #4: You need to ignore case, so consider forcing the string to either lowercase or uppercase before comparing.
